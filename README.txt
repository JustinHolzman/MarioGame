So I went with a mario theme to transform this game into something fun. I have added many features to this game, some 
behind the scenes and some that are noticeable. I will let you know what to look for to see just what I have done. First 
off you will see that I have added a Main menu to the game with several options. There is also a vast library of sounds 
and music that will be clear if you have the volume turned up! The main theme on the menu screen also has a feature that 
fades by 10 decibels when another sound clips are played. I did this because the music was overpowering the sound clips so I thought it was needed. On the main screen you will also see there is a high score system I set in place. The scores are 
recorded for the top 5 but can easily be changed to top 10 or any number desired. The scores are stored into a text file 
located in the directory. There are several classes that were put in place to create this high score system as you will 
see. Once you start the game you will notice that there are a few changes to the pictures of each player. I kept the pictures 
of the blocked cave and open cave so that you would feel somewhat at home and know how to play. There is also an "AI" that 
was implemented into the game which will be seen as the "Chomp Chomp" on the board. This AI can move to any space on the 
board and will kill any player that is currently moving. I decided he could only kill players moving because in mario 64 
he only attacks you if you are moving in the game. He moves one space each time you move a player. I also added a roulette block that is cycling pictures on the screen, move any player onto this space to get a +300 points to your score! There is a small probiblity for them to pop up so be sure to refresh the game till you have some you can take advantage of. The object of the game 
is to save princess peach in the bottom. The characters each have an ability just like assignment 4. To see how to play 
simply click "How to Play" located on the main screen or on the menu bar during the game. Which brings me to the next 
addition which is a menu bar located on the top of the game board. This will allow you to choose from several options 
including returning to the main screen. I have put many days into re-hauling this game and found this very fun to work on. 
I hope you enjoy the game as much as I had fun creating it! Be sure to save princess peach and get your name on the top of the 
leader board!

Note: Once you click start there will be a prompt for you to enter your name. This is required to get the name for the high score list. You may enter any name or press cancel or close the prompt to return to the main menu. I also added Java doc's for each class and method within the program. I have also locked the window size for the game which I thought was needed.
